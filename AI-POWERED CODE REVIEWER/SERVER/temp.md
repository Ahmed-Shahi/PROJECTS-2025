❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
funtion sum(){return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ **Typo:** `funtion` should be `function`.
* ❌ **Undefined Variables:** `a` and `b` are used without being declared or passed as parameters, leading to
`ReferenceError` if not globally defined, or relying on global state, which is bad practice.
* ❌ **Lack of Parameters:** A sum function should typically accept the numbers it needs to sum as arguments.
* ❌ **No Error Handling:** If `a` or `b` are not numbers, the result might be `NaN` without any explicit check.
* ❌ **Lack of Documentation:** No comments or JSDoc to explain the function's purpose, parameters, or return value.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} num1 - The first number.
* @param {number} num2 - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
// Basic type checking (optional, depending on strictness)
if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
console.warn('Warning: sum() expects two numbers. Received:', num1, num2);
// Or throw new TypeError("Expected two numbers for sum operation.");
return NaN; // Or handle as per application's error strategy
}
return num1 + num2;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ **Correct Syntax:** Corrected `funtion` to `function`.
* ✔ **Clear Parameters:** `num1` and `num2` are explicitly defined as parameters, making the function reusable and
independent of global state.
* ✔ **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** The function clearly states its inputs and purpose.
* ✔ **Basic Type Checking (Optional but Recommended):** Added a check to ensure inputs are numbers, improving robustness
and preventing unexpected `NaN` results silently.
* ✔ **Proper Documentation:** Added a JSDoc block to explain the function, its parameters, and what it returns,
improving maintainability for future developers.

Final Note:
Always ensure functions are self-contained and explicitly define their dependencies (via parameters) rather than relying
on global variables. This significantly improves reusability, testability, and reduces side effects.
